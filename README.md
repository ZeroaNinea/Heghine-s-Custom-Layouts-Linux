# Heghine's Custom Layouts for Linux

This repository contains all custom keyboard layouts that I've created or modified for Linux with the Ubuntu distribution. I modified the files in the `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/` directory on Linux. If you want to use the same layouts just replace the files from the `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/` directory with the ones from this repository.

## ⚠️ Warning

> You're editing the system files of Linux! You should replace the files exactly with the same names as the ones in this repository. If you don't, you might break something. You can also make a backup of the original files before editing them. I'm also not sure if keyboard files are same in other distributions. Check it first.

## Armenian ՄՈՒԿԸ/ԱՆԻ

I've edited the Armenian ՄՈՒԿԸ/ԱՆԻ keyboard layout on Linux by adding all the missing symbols from the QWERTY layout.

Now I can type the word "ինչ-որ" without switching the keyboard.
